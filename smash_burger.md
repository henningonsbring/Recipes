# Smash burger
## Ingredients
- Minced meat (coarsely ground chuck beef is recommended)
- Tallow (Optional)
- Cheddar slices
- Salt
- Black pepper
## Recommended equipment
- Cast iron frying pan
- Metal spatula
- Smash burger press
## Procedure
1. Optional: Adjust the fat content of the ground meat by adding tallow, aiming for a fat percentage between 25% and 30%. For instance, mixing 500 g of 15% fat ground meat with 70 g of tallow will result in 25% fat, yielding six 95 g burgers.
2. Roll the minced meat into balls, each weighing about 90 g.
3. Place the rolled minced meat in the fridge.
4. Prepare any other additions you'll be including in the hamburger buns.
5. Place the pan over high heat. Start with the stove set to level 8 out of 9 for the first burger, and adjust as needed.
6. Place a meatball in the pan and gently press to retain its shape. After a few seconds of frying, flip the meatball and immediately flatten it. This prevents the meat from adhering to the press.
7. Season with salt and pepper, then fry for 1 minute.
8. Flip the burger and place a slice of cheddar on top right away.
9. Fry for 1 minute on the other side.
