# Smash burger
## Ingredients
- Minced meat (coarsely ground chuck beef is recommended)
- Tallow
- Cheddar slices
- Salt
- Black pepper
- Oil (or butter) to fry
## Recommended equipment
- Cast iron frying pan
- Metal spatula
- Smash burger press
- Baking paper
## Procedure
1. Adjust the fat content of the ground meat by adding tallow, aiming for a fat percentage between 25% and 30%. For instance, mixing 500 g of 15% fat ground meat with 70 g of tallow will result in 25% fat, yielding six 95 g burgers.
2. Roll the minced meat into balls, each weighing about 90 g.
3. Place the rolled minced meat in the fridge.
4. Prepare any other additions you'll be including in the hamburger buns.
5. Heat oil in a frying pan over high heat.
6. Place a meatball in the pan and immediately smash it flat. Use baking paper to avoid minced meat getting stuck to the burger press.
7. Season with salt and pepper, frying for 1 minute (step 7 out of 9 is a good starting point for the first burger - adjust as needed).
8. Flip the burger and place a slice of cheddar on top right away.
9. Fry for 1 minute on the other side.
