## Procedure
### Dough
1. Mix 5 dl flour, salt, sugar, and cardamom in a bowl
2. Crumble the yeast into another bowl (i.e. not same bowl as step 1)
3. Melt the butter and add the milk
4. Heat the butter and milk mix until 37 °C
5. Pour the butter and milk over the yeast, then mix
6. Add the dry ingredients from step 1 into bowl with butter, milk and yeast
7. Add the remaining part of the flour (7.5 dl) to the dough and work it until smooth
8. Prepare the butter for the filling by putting it in room temperature
9. Let the dough raise for 45 minutes
10. Put the dough on a floured baking surface and work it
11. Add flour until the dough no longer sticks to the baking surface
12. Separate the dough into four equally sized pieces
### Assembling the Buns
13. Take one of the dough pieces and roll out to a rectangular shape with a rolling pin, making the long side long enough to cut 12 buns, each about 1 cm thick
14. Distribute a quarter of the filling evenly across the rolled-out dough
15. Begin rolling the dough from the long side into a compact roll
16. Cut the roll into 12 buns
17. Put each bun into a paper mold with the side closest to the cut upwards
18. Repeat the "Assembling the buns" section 3 times
### Bake the buns
19. Let the buns raise under a kitchen towel for 30 minutes
20. Brush the buns with beaten egg
21. Bake the buns in the oven at 235 °C until they are golden brown (about 8 minutes)
22. Let the buns cool down under a kitchen towel, which prevents them from getting dry
23. Use freezer as long term storage in plastic bags (defrost in the same bag for about 1 hour)
