# Schnitzel
Adapted from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR_ERC6IcKM
## Ingredients
- 2x pork loin or pork chops around 2.5 cm thick (pre butterfly-cut will save time and require less skill)
- Salt
- Black pepper
- 2.5 dl flour
- 2x egg
- 2.5 dl bread crumbs
- 5 dl rapeseed oil
## Recommended equipment
- Meat mallet (to flatten the meat)
- Tong (to pick up the schnitzel from the pan)
## Procedure
1. Trim any excess fat and remove any bone from the edges.
2. If not using pre-butterfly-cut pork, then take a 2.5 cm thick piece of pork and carefully slice it horizontally almost all the way through, leaving about 1 cm intact along one edge to create a hinge. Open it up like a book and gently press it flat, ensuring an even thickness of approximately 1.25 cm.
3. Add salt and black pepper.
4. Put in a plastic bag and hammer out until an even thickness of around 4 mm. Work from the center to the edge with the hammer.
5. Put flour on a plate.
6. Put beaten eggs in a deep plate.
7. Put bread crumbs in another plate.
8. Start heating the oil in a pan over medium-high heat (setting 7 out of 9 on the stove is a good starting point).
9. Flip the pork in flour.
10. Flip the flour-coated pork in egg.
11. Flip the flour and egg-coated pork in bread crumbs.
12. Drop a few breadcrumbs into the oil, if they sizzle and quickly move across the surface, the temperature is just right. If they sink slowly to the bottom, the oil is not hot enough. If the oil is not hot enough increase the heat one step and repeat this step.
13. Fry the schnitzel for 1 minute, continuously spooning hot oil from the pan over the top.
14. Get ready in time to pick up the schnitzel from the pan, not many seconds beyond 1 minute is needed for the coating to burn.
